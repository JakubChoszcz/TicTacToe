## Launch
Tic Tac Toe is a simple game for players or (as here) a player and AI[^1]

## What Was My Motivation?
I wanted to enjoy and improve my programming skills by creating a game, at first I wanted to implement real artificial intelligence.
I started studying MINIMAX, but after some time I decided to build a fake artificial intelligence and maybe create real artificial intelligence in the future.

## Build Process, I ...
1. Designed the layout.
2. Wrote the desktop version.
3. Create 'Change Theme' option.
3. Added a version for tablet and mobile.
4. Create a ability to play with a second player.
5. Create a 'Winner Checker'.
5. Added the AI.
6. Create a 'Switch On/Off AI' function.

## All Techonologies Used
- ` React Hooks ` 
- ` JavaScript `
- ` React.js ` 
- ` HTML `
- ` CSS `

## Features
- Responsive Web Designe.
- Ability to play with AI/a second player.
- Ability to change the theme.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to Font Awesome for being able to use icons, and GitHub for the GitHub Pages feature.

[^1]: I use the word AI only for simplicity, but it's not really AI, the program just use "Random.Math()" which selects a random field from empty fields on the current board.
